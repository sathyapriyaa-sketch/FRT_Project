# FRT_Project
A sample deep learning project is created that is made to recognize classes of pictures using the CIFAR-10 dataset (plane, frog, ship). In this, the following steps are executed: Azure Storage is used to securely store the pictures, Azure Databricks is used to train the model using Keras and TensorFlow & Azure ML Service is used to version and deploy model as HTTP endpoint.
Incase if anyone wishes to make modifications, he/she can change the azure workspace credentials, testing it then.
Demo of the deep learning model ran with all of the azure modules(bricks, storage, ML Service) mentioned in the synopsis  visualised alongwith CIFAR10 dataset(link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q55YlKIHXPFaQJbFpEem41U2n8gqedbP/view?usp=sharing) which on potential development
the classification of X-ray images that could be employed in the medical sector as preferably mentioned.

Incase of evaluation -- these would be my login credentials with azure :
workspace="newws"
resource_grp="newres"
subscription_id="Workspace-e18a6833-eeb6-4db0-858d-b098746f4034-deployment"
and the package is - "student developer package"
